# WatFit - An IOS Fitness Application

WatFit is a fitness app that uses motion sensing capabilities of the IPhone to both provide guidance on various excercises, as well as assess your form to provide a complete overiew of how effective your workout is. 

# Background
There is a particular science behind performing an exercise correctly, and big part of how you do it depends on the pace of the exercise, as well as the technique use. There are 3 reasons why you should pace yourself at a constant rate when peforming:
- prevent momentum to perform exercise
- prevent joint injury 
- maximum exercise benefits

This app seeks to give you real time output while you are performing an exercise to give you accurate feedback, giving you an oppurtunity to perfect your workout form. 

# Features:
- minimalistic design for easier workout
- Automatic detection of different phases of a workout, without any user input.
- Motion sensing allows for good or bad reps depending on incorrect initial angle, or outstanding acceleration detected via gyroscope and accelerometer.
- Appropriate visual and audio cues for the technique you use.
- Rest period, and allows for changing reps and sets mid rest.
- Scoring mechanism for final feedback
